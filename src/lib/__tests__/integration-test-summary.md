# CV Ingestion Integration Tests Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive integration tests implemented for the CV ingestion feature as part of task 13.

## Test Files Created/Updated

### 1. New Integration Test File: `cv-ingestion-integration.test.ts`

This is the main integration test file that covers the complete CV ingestion workflow with 11 comprehensive test cases.

#### Test Categories:

**End-to-End CV Ingestion Flow (3 tests)**
- Complete workflow from raw text to stored CV
- Multiple CV ingestion and switching
- CV data persistence across store operations

**CV Management Operations (3 tests)**
- Complete CRUD operations on ingested CVs
- CV editing and re-processing workflow
- Data integrity during concurrent operations

**Error Recovery and Resilience (4 tests)**
- Recovery from AI processing failures without store corruption
- Graceful handling of storage errors
- Malformed CV data handling
- Consistency during rapid state changes

**Multi-language Support (1 test)**
- CV ingestion in different languages (French, Portuguese)

### 2. Updated Integration Test File: `integration.test.ts`

Added 2 new test cases to the existing OpenRouter integration tests:

**CV Ingestion Integration (2 tests)**
- Integration of CV ingestion with existing OpenRouter flow
- CV switching in complete user workflow

## Test Coverage

### End-to-End Workflows Tested

1. **Complete CV Ingestion Process**
   - Raw text input → AI processing → JSON formatting → Store persistence → Current CV setting
   - Validates entire pipeline from user input to final state

2. **Multiple CV Management**
   - Ingesting multiple CVs
   - Switching between different CVs
   - Maintaining separate CV data integrity

3. **CV Editing and Re-processing**
   - Loading existing CV for editing
   - Re-processing updated raw text through AI
   - Updating stored CV with new formatted data

4. **Integration with Existing Features**
   - CV ingestion working with OpenRouter API
   - Ingested CVs working with resume tailoring
   - State management integration with other app features

### Error Scenarios Tested

1. **AI Processing Failures**
   - Network errors during AI calls
   - Malformed AI responses
   - Empty or invalid AI responses
   - Store state remains uncorrupted after failures

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Concurrent operations on CV data
   - Rapid state changes
   - Storage operation failures
   - Recovery from corrupted data scenarios

3. **Multi-language Support**
   - French CV ingestion with language-specific prompts
   - Portuguese CV ingestion with language-specific prompts
   - Proper AI prompt localization

### Persistence and State Management

1. **Store Integration**
   - CV data persistence across browser sessions
   - Integration with existing store state (API keys, models, etc.)
   - State consistency during multiple operations

2. **CV Switching**
   - Loading different CVs as current CV
   - Maintaining ingested CV list integrity
   - Proper state transitions

## Key Integration Points Validated

1. **Server Actions Integration**
   - `ingestCV` server action working end-to-end
   - Proper error handling and propagation
   - AI response processing and validation

2. **Store Integration**
   - Zustand store CRUD operations for CVs
   - State persistence and retrieval
   - Integration with existing store features

3. **Multi-language Support**
   - Language-specific AI prompts
   - Proper localization handling
   - Consistent behavior across languages

4. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation on failures
   - User-friendly error messages
   - System recovery capabilities

## Test Quality Metrics

- **11 comprehensive integration tests** in the new file
- **2 additional integration tests** in the existing file
- **All tests passing** with proper mocking and isolation
- **Complete workflow coverage** from input to final state
- **Error scenario coverage** for resilience testing
- **Multi-language support validation**
- **Concurrent operation testing** for data integrity

## Mock Strategy

The tests use comprehensive mocking to:
- Mock OpenAI API responses for predictable testing
- Simulate various error conditions
- Test different AI response formats
- Validate proper error handling without external dependencies

## Validation Approach

Each test validates:
1. **Input processing** - Raw text validation and processing
2. **AI integration** - Proper API calls with correct parameters
3. **Data transformation** - Raw text to structured CV format
4. **State management** - Store operations and persistence
5. **Error handling** - Graceful failure and recovery
6. **Integration points** - Interaction with existing features

This comprehensive test suite ensures the CV ingestion feature works reliably in all scenarios and integrates properly with the existing application architecture.
