# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing cover letter generation functionality by adding company-specific information collection and implementing a structured cover letter format. The enhanced system will collect job position, company description, and job description through a modal interface, then generate a professionally formatted cover letter that follows a specific structure with proper salutations, company flattery, personal introduction, collaboration vision, and interview request.
