# Context

This is feature of this personal CV website. This feature allows the user to add a job description, and the website should tailor the current CV based on the job description using AI.

The base of the CV is the [fullstack.json](mdc:src/variants/fullstack.json) file, and this consistutes the full description of the candidate experiences and skills. This file should be used together with the job description to make a tailored CV.

# How to?

The user should be able to click a button, or something similar, to add a job description. This can be made with a modal. The button should only be present if a localhost item is present. The localhost item could be called `resume-tailoring`.

After the user submits the job description, we need to use OpenAI APIs submit the contents of [fullstack.json](mdc:src/variants/fullstack.json) (perhaps extracted into raw text, to avoid too much token usage) and the job description.

The return of the OpenAPI request should be formatted as JSON, and this JSON should be a sub-set of [fullstack.json](mdc:src/variants/fullstack.json). So we will basically replace the contents of the state in the [App.tsx](mdc:src/App.tsx) with the returned data. 

# What information is needed?

The most important information to be tailored by the AI is the summary, skills, and professional experience.

Information like contact, and languages are irrelevant and can be static.

Information like education, certifications and publications can be occasional, and only placed if relevant.
